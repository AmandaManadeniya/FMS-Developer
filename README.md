Gameplay based activities for young children to practice their fine motor and digital literacy skills

There will be two modes: 
1. Laptop trackpad 
2. Traditional mouse 

INITIAL CONCEPT: 

3 MAIN STAGES: 
* 1. Clicking 
* 2. Dragging 
* 3. Scrolling 

** each stage will consist of substages that increase in difficulty ** 

There will be a point system which users can use to unlock new skins/characters for the game. 

As these are basic skills it will be a short-term game with a maximum expected completion lifecycle of 20 minutes. The game will be catered to 5/6year olds with developing fine motor skills AND children with no experience using a mouse.
